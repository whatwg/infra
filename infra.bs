<h2 id=goals class=no-num>Goals</h2>

<ul>
 <li><p>Deduplicate boilerplate in standards.

 <li><p>Align standards on conventions, terminology, and data structures.
</ul>

<p>Suggestions for more goals welcome.</p>


<h2 id=usage>Usage</h2>

<p>To make use of the Infra Standard in a document titled <var>X</var>, use
<samp><var>X</var> depends on the Infra Standard.</samp> Additionally, cross-referencing terminology
is encouraged to avoid ambiguity.


<h2 id=conventions>Conventions</h2>

<h3 id=conformance>Conformance</h3>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked
non-normative. Everything else is normative.

<p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119. [[!RFC2119]]

<p>These keywords have equivalent meaning when written in lowercase and cannot appear in
non-normative content. Standards are encouraged to limit themselves to "must", "must not", "should",
and "may".

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading spaces"
or "return false") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the keyword (e.g., "must") used in
introducing the algorithm or step.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

<h2 id=primitive-data-types>Primitive data types</h2>

<h3 id=bytes>Bytes</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>byte</dfn> is a sequence of eight bits, represented as a double-digit hexadecimal
number in the range 0x00 to 0xFF, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII byte</dfn> is a <a>byte</a> in the range 0x00 to 0x7F, inclusive.

<h3 id=byte-sequences>Byte sequences</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>byte sequence</dfn> is a sequence of <a>bytes</a>. Byte sequences with bytes in the
range 0x00 to 0x7F, inclusive, can be marked up with backticks, to avoid confusion with an actual
string.

<p class=example id=example-byte-sequence-notation>Headers, such as `<code>Content-Type</code>`,
are <a>byte sequences</a>.

<p>To <dfn export>byte-lowercase</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a>, increase each <a>byte</a> it
contains, in the range 0x41 to 0x5A, inclusive, by 0x20.

<p>To <dfn export>byte-uppercase</dfn> a <a>byte sequence</a>, subtract each <a>byte</a> it
contains, in the range 0x61 to 0x7A, inclusive, by 0x20.

<h3 id=code-points>Code points</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>code point</dfn> is a Unicode code point and is represented as a four-to-six digit
hexadecimal number, typically prefixed with "U+". In certain contexts <a>code points</a> are
prefixed with "0x". [[!UNICODE]]

<p class=example id=example-code-point-notation>The <a>code point</a> rendered as ðŸ¤” is
represented as U+1F914.

<p>A <dfn export>scalar value</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> that is not in the range
U+D800 to U+DFFF, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII code point</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0000 to U+007F,
inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII tab or newline</dfn> is U+0009, U+000A, or U+000D.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII whitespace</dfn> is U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020.

<p>A <dfn export>C0 control</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0000 to U+001F, inclusive.

<p>A <dfn export>C0 control or space</dfn> is a <a>C0 control</a> or U+0020.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII digit</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0030 to U+0039,
inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII hex digit</dfn> is an <a>ASCII digit</a>, a <a>code point</a> in the range
U+0041 to U+0046, inclusive, or a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0061 to U+0066, inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alpha upper</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0041 to U+005A,
inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alpha lower</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the range U+0061 to U+007A,
inclusive.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alpha</dfn> is an <a>ASCII alpha upper</a> or <a>ASCII alpha lower</a>.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII alphanumeric</dfn> is an <a>ASCII digit</a> or <a>ASCII alpha</a>.

<h3 id=strings>Strings</h3>

<p>A <dfn export>string</dfn> is a sequence of <a>code points</a>. Strings are denoted by double
quotes and monospace font.

<p class=example id=example-string-notation>"<code>Hello, world!</code>" is a string.

<p>An <dfn export>ASCII string</dfn> is a <a>string</a> whose <a>code points</a> are all
<a>ASCII code points</a>.

<p>To <dfn export>ASCII lowercase</dfn> a <a>string</a>, replace all <a>ASCII alpha upper</a> in the
<a>string</a> with the corresponding <a>code points</a> in <a>ASCII alpha lower</a>.

<p>To <dfn export>ASCII uppercase</dfn> a <a>string</a>, replace all <a>ASCII alpha lower</a> in the
<a>string</a> with the corresponding <a>code points</a> in <a>ASCII alpha upper</a>.

<p>A <a>string</a> <var>A</var> is an <dfn export>ASCII case-insensitive</dfn> match for a
<a>string</a> <var>B</var>, if the <a>ASCII lowercase</a> of <var>A</var> is the
<a>ASCII lowercase</a> of <var>B</var>.
